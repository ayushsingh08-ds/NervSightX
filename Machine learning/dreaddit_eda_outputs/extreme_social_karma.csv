Not sure the best way to describe it but for the last week and a half I have had to be social and around people every day except for a couple of hours each evening and it is KILLING ME. I’m on edge constantly because I need a break to just start over. And now I’m on the way to a 3 day work seminar in another country and I feel like there is zero mental energy left. I get back and then have work on Monday again. Anyone else feel like they need a day or two alone to “recharge” their (mental) energy?,1,1541738150,936,4.732578616,104,69.24,22.08,99.0,62.24,20.8,8.65,98.08,58.65,12.5,8.65,6.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.92,3.85,7.69,16.35,7.69,6.73,9.62,0.96,15.38,3.85,2.88,0.0,3.85,3.85,5.77,3.85,1.92,0.0,0.96,0.96,4.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.5,1.92,0.96,1.92,1.92,1.92,4.81,2.88,0.0,0.0,1.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.77,0.96,2.88,1.92,1.92,0.0,1.92,16.35,0.96,25.0,0.0,11.54,13.46,2.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.58,3.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,1.92,1.92,1.92,0.0,2.7143,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.72981,1.56,1.83439,0.99,89,5.660377358,0.04166666667,0.8,9vhgbm,24942,anxiety,502,"['Not', 'sure', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'describe', 'it', 'but', 'for', 'the', 'last', 'week', 'and', 'a', 'half', 'I', 'have', 'had', 'to', 'be', 'social', 'and', 'around', 'people', 'every', 'day', 'except', 'for', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'hours', 'each', 'evening', 'and', 'it', 'is', 'KILLING', 'ME', '.', 'I', '’', 'm', 'on', 'edge', 'constantly', 'because', 'I', 'need', 'a', 'break', 'to', 'just', 'start', 'over', '.', 'And', 'now', 'I', '’', 'm', 'on', 'the', 'way', 'to', 'a', '3', 'day', 'work', 'seminar', 'in', 'another', 'country', 'and', 'I', 'feel', 'like', 'there', 'is', 'zero', 'mental', 'energy', 'left', '.', 'I', 'get', 'back', 'and', 'then', 'have', 'work', 'on', 'Monday', 'again', '.', 'Anyone', 'else', 'feel', 'like', 'they', 'need', 'a', 'day', 'or', 'two', 'alone', 'to', '“', 'recharge', '”', 'their', '(', 'mental', ')', 'energy', '?']",117
