I have been doing my absolute best to pass but the subject were very difficult on my own....I have tried studying and watching old lectures and everything but the syllabus was too long in several cases ( mathematics was much more difficult and longer than abitur according to our professor) and exams were just too hard for me in my situation so I failed. The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company.,0,1522771890,2,8.980789141,175,33.95,24.63,93.91,6.61,43.75,21.71,92.57,57.14,18.29,13.71,10.86,0.57,0.0,1.14,1.14,4.57,5.14,10.86,9.71,6.29,8.0,0.0,15.43,6.29,2.86,1.71,1.71,2.86,5.14,1.71,3.43,0.0,0.0,1.14,6.86,0.0,1.14,1.14,0.0,9.14,1.14,1.71,0.57,1.71,1.71,3.43,2.86,2.29,0.0,0.57,0.57,0.0,0.57,0.0,0.0,10.29,2.86,4.0,2.86,1.14,2.86,6.86,5.71,0.0,16.57,2.29,6.86,9.14,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.71,4.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,0.0,3.0,2.5714,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.75036,1.52278,1.86588,1.0,0,8.194621212,-0.02118055556,0.0,89fez8,733,stress,955,"['Im', 'studying', 'at', 'a', 'university', 'abroad', 'And', 'I', 'have', 'failed', 'or', 'got', 'a', 'really', 'bad', 'grade', 'my', 'first', 'semester', 'subjects', 'due', 'to', 'starting', 'a', 'month', 'late', 'and', 'searching', 'for', 'accommodation', 'for', 'atleast', '2', 'weeks', 'or', 'I', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'on', 'the', 'streets', '.', 'I', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'my', 'absolute', 'best', 'to', 'pass', 'but', 'the', 'subject', 'were', 'very', 'difficult', 'on', 'my', 'own', '....', 'I', 'have', 'tried', 'studying', 'and', 'watching', 'old', 'lectures', 'and', 'everything', 'but', 'the', 'syllabus', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'in', 'several', 'cases', '(', 'mathematics', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'and', 'longer', 'than', 'abitur', 'according', 'to', 'our', 'professor', ')', 'and', 'exams', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'for', 'me', 'in', 'my', 'situation', 'so', 'I', 'failed', '.', 'The', 'thing', 'is', 'she', 'linked', 'this', 'with', 'studying', 'with', 'my', 'friends', 'which', 'I', 'only', 'recently', 'started', 'doing', 'it', 'because', 'they', 'were', 'very', 'helpful', 'and', 'my', 'progress', 'increased', 'significantly', '.', 'She', 'now', 'commands', 'me', 'to', 'just', 'cut', 'all', 'relations', 'with', 'any', 'friends', 'that', 'I', 'have', 'made', 'whom', 'for', 'the', 'first', 'time', 'in', 'my', 'life', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'i', 'looked', 'forward', 'to', 'seeing', 'them', 'the', 'next', 'day', 'because', 'I', 'enjoy', 'there', 'company', '.']",182

"I hadn't realized until a year ago, but this gave me ptsd and shaped the way I interact with men and boys. Now I'm dating a boy who is very sweet, very understanding and such, but I often find myself thinking about ending it because his behavior feels too ""man-ish"" to me, and it makes me uncomfortable and scares me. It puts me in a very irritated state - a response to feeling threatened by men in my case - and often starts ""discourse"" between us. Luckily he is very understanding and we talked about it a lot, but whenever he asks me what he's doing that makes me uncomfortable, I can't answer, I can't put it into words, which means he can't change his behavior perfectly and that the cycle will start over again. I'm fighting as hard as I can against the effects of my ptsd on my relationship, as it is very important to me to make it work, but I know when we end it, it will be partly caused by it.",1,1518480571,5,9.866538462,175,10.21,32.39,98.94,11.11,35.0,13.71,96.0,64.57,26.29,17.14,12.0,1.71,0.0,3.43,0.0,9.14,4.57,12.0,6.86,8.57,10.86,2.29,16.57,2.86,1.71,2.86,0.0,1.14,5.71,2.29,3.43,2.86,1.14,0.0,12.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.29,18.29,6.29,4.57,0.0,2.86,0.57,4.57,2.29,0.0,0.0,1.71,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,6.29,3.43,1.14,1.71,0.57,0.57,2.86,14.29,1.14,15.43,2.86,4.0,8.57,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.14,2.86,6.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.71,2.29,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.7143,2.8,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.69703,1.50943,1.85778,0.78,8,9.851098901,0.1283333333,0.0,7x5b9v,1542,ptsd,905,"['I', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'until', 'a', 'year', 'ago', ',', 'but', 'this', 'gave', 'me', 'ptsd', 'and', 'shaped', 'the', 'way', 'I', 'interact', 'with', 'men', 'and', 'boys', '.', 'Now', 'I', ""'m"", 'dating', 'a', 'boy', 'who', 'is', 'very', 'sweet', ',', 'very', 'understanding', 'and', 'such', ',', 'but', 'I', 'often', 'find', 'myself', 'thinking', 'about', 'ending', 'it', 'because', 'his', 'behavior', 'feels', 'too', '``', 'man-ish', ""''"", 'to', 'me', ',', 'and', 'it', 'makes', 'me', 'uncomfortable', 'and', 'scares', 'me', '.', 'It', 'puts', 'me', 'in', 'a', 'very', 'irritated', 'state', '-', 'a', 'response', 'to', 'feeling', 'threatened', 'by', 'men', 'in', 'my', 'case', '-', 'and', 'often', 'starts', '``', 'discourse', ""''"", 'between', 'us', '.', 'Luckily', 'he', 'is', 'very', 'understanding', 'and', 'we', 'talked', 'about', 'it', 'a', 'lot', ',', 'but', 'whenever', 'he', 'asks', 'me', 'what', 'he', ""'s"", 'doing', 'that', 'makes', 'me', 'uncomfortable', ',', 'I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', ',', 'I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'it', 'into', 'words', ',', 'which', 'means', 'he', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'his', 'behavior', 'perfectly', 'and', 'that', 'the', 'cycle', 'will', 'start', 'over', 'again', '.', 'I', ""'m"", 'fighting', 'as', 'hard', 'as', 'I', 'can', 'against', 'the', 'effects', 'of', 'my', 'ptsd', 'on', 'my', 'relationship', ',', 'as', 'it', 'is', 'very', 'important', 'to', 'me', 'to', 'make', 'it', 'work', ',', 'but', 'I', 'know', 'when', 'we', 'end', 'it', ',', 'it', 'will', 'be', 'partly', 'caused', 'by', 'it', '.']",203
