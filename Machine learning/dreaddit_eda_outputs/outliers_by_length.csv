"My girlfriend and I have been amazingly strong for the last 8 months, shortly before new years she told me that she feels very much in ""love"" with me but ""doesnt feel right"". She wanted an unknown amount of time away from the relationship saying only a couple of weeks and still wanted to keep the same ground rules as when were together (monogomous, etc..) Shes vague when i try and talk to her about it, stating she just feels like somethings wrong and that shes doing this so she can fix her self and come back to 'us' stronger I talked to her again last night and as always shes adamant this is because she loves me and wants us to work more then anything... Shes never lied to me before, not even over little things so i have no reason to doubt her intentions. Basically i said i feel like her backup and i wanted to breakup untill this 'problem' is resolved so today we split for a month",0,1514950506,1,7.134255051,171,14.86,79.35,31.62,47.39,34.2,10.53,95.32,61.99,22.81,17.54,7.02,1.75,0.0,8.77,0.0,5.26,3.51,14.04,7.6,9.36,10.53,2.34,16.37,7.02,5.26,1.17,0.58,2.34,5.85,3.51,2.34,0.58,0.58,0.0,17.54,0.0,0.58,6.43,0.0,14.04,3.51,1.75,2.92,3.51,1.17,1.75,3.51,0.0,1.17,2.34,1.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.11,5.26,1.75,2.34,0.0,1.75,5.26,12.87,1.17,17.54,0.58,5.85,11.7,0.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.28,4.09,2.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.34,2.34,1.17,0.0,3.0,2.6364,2.8,1.125,1.125,1.0,1.69564,1.52752,1.90936,0.66,2,6.451439394,0.05105360326,0.6,7nrxo3,864,relationships,893,"['My', 'girlfriend', 'and', 'I', 'have', 'been', 'amazingly', 'strong', 'for', 'the', 'last', '8', 'months', ',', 'shortly', 'before', 'new', 'years', 'she', 'told', 'me', 'that', 'she', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'in', '``', 'love', ""''"", 'with', 'me', 'but', '``', 'doesnt', 'feel', 'right', ""''"", '.', 'She', 'wanted', 'an', 'unknown', 'amount', 'of', 'time', 'away', 'from', 'the', 'relationship', 'saying', 'only', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'weeks', 'and', 'still', 'wanted', 'to', 'keep', 'the', 'same', 'ground', 'rules', 'as', 'when', 'were', 'together', '(', 'monogomous', ',', 'etc', '..', ')', 'Shes', 'vague', 'when', 'i', 'try', 'and', 'talk', 'to', 'her', 'about', 'it', ',', 'stating', 'she', 'just', 'feels', 'like', 'somethings', 'wrong', 'and', 'that', 'shes', 'doing', 'this', 'so', 'she', 'can', 'fix', 'her', 'self', 'and', 'come', 'back', 'to', ""'us"", ""'"", 'stronger', 'I', 'talked', 'to', 'her', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'and', 'as', 'always', 'shes', 'adamant', 'this', 'is', 'because', 'she', 'loves', 'me', 'and', 'wants', 'us', 'to', 'work', 'more', 'then', 'anything', '...', 'Shes', 'never', 'lied', 'to', 'me', 'before', ',', 'not', 'even', 'over', 'little', 'things', 'so', 'i', 'have', 'no', 'reason', 'to', 'doubt', 'her', 'intentions', '.', 'Basically', 'i', 'said', 'i', 'feel', 'like', 'her', 'backup', 'and', 'i', 'wanted', 'to', 'breakup', 'untill', 'this', ""'problem"", ""'"", 'is', 'resolved', 'so', 'today', 'we', 'split', 'for', 'a', 'month']",187
"Okay this is driving totally insane and I can't function normally because of it, I have had intrusive thoughts basically for as long as I can remember, though now they are pushing me closer and closer to insanity. I am only focusing on one disturbing thought now which I really only need serious and helpful answers for. To start off, I remember it being the start off 2015 and I was sleeping over at my best friends house who we will call ""J"". Now J and I would always stay up all night when having sleepovers, and this certain night I managed to pull through to 6:30 am 30 minutes after J had fallen asleep, though when I woke up I was in his sisters bed. Now since then up until now, I just assumed that I was literally half asleep and that I was just looking for anywhere comfortable to sleep that wasn't taken in my literally half asleep state of mind (both his sisters had stayed up all night in the living room I've believed up until this moment, also something to keep in mind is that both of us were to young to be consuming alcohol and I have no memory of myself entering their room.",1,1514610817,2,11.14877358,210,24.86,25.24,99.0,52.57,42.0,18.1,91.43,60.95,18.1,12.38,9.52,0.95,0.0,0.95,0.95,5.71,0.95,17.14,10.95,8.57,9.05,1.43,19.52,7.14,2.86,1.9,3.33,1.9,3.33,2.38,0.95,0.48,0.0,0.0,5.71,0.95,0.48,0.95,0.95,11.9,3.81,0.95,1.43,1.43,2.38,2.38,0.48,0.48,0.0,0.0,3.33,2.38,0.95,0.0,0.48,7.14,2.86,0.48,3.81,0.95,0.0,8.1,10.0,0.95,23.81,3.33,11.43,10.0,0.48,0.48,1.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,9.05,2.38,3.33,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.95,1.43,0.48,0.0,3.0,2.75,3.0,1.1429,1.1429,1.0,1.69058,1.49286,1.88429,1.0,1,10.7195283,0.01054421769,1.0,7mzr4x,21808,anxiety,1093,"['Okay', 'this', 'is', 'driving', 'totally', 'insane', 'and', 'I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'normally', 'because', 'of', 'it', ',', 'I', 'have', 'had', 'intrusive', 'thoughts', 'basically', 'for', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'I', 'can', 'remember', ',', 'though', 'now', 'they', 'are', 'pushing', 'me', 'closer', 'and', 'closer', 'to', 'insanity', '.', 'I', 'am', 'only', 'focusing', 'on', 'one', 'disturbing', 'thought', 'now', 'which', 'I', 'really', 'only', 'need', 'serious', 'and', 'helpful', 'answers', 'for', '.', 'To', 'start', 'off', ',', 'I', 'remember', 'it', 'being', 'the', 'start', 'off', '2015', 'and', 'I', 'was', 'sleeping', 'over', 'at', 'my', 'best', 'friends', 'house', 'who', 'we', 'will', 'call', '``', 'J', ""''"", '.', 'Now', 'J', 'and', 'I', 'would', 'always', 'stay', 'up', 'all', 'night', 'when', 'having', 'sleepovers', ',', 'and', 'this', 'certain', 'night', 'I', 'managed', 'to', 'pull', 'through', 'to', '6:30', 'am', '30', 'minutes', 'after', 'J', 'had', 'fallen', 'asleep', ',', 'though', 'when', 'I', 'woke', 'up', 'I', 'was', 'in', 'his', 'sisters', 'bed', '.', 'Now', 'since', 'then', 'up', 'until', 'now', ',', 'I', 'just', 'assumed', 'that', 'I', 'was', 'literally', 'half', 'asleep', 'and', 'that', 'I', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'for', 'anywhere', 'comfortable', 'to', 'sleep', 'that', 'was', ""n't"", 'taken', 'in', 'my', 'literally', 'half', 'asleep', 'state', 'of', 'mind', '(', 'both', 'his', 'sisters', 'had', 'stayed', 'up', 'all', 'night', 'in', 'the', 'living', 'room', 'I', ""'ve"", 'believed', 'up', 'until', 'this', 'moment', ',', 'also', 'something', 'to', 'keep', 'in', 'mind', 'is', 'that', 'both', 'of', 'us', 'were', 'to', 'young', 'to', 'be', 'consuming', 'alcohol', 'and', 'I', 'have', 'no', 'memory', 'of', 'myself', 'entering', 'their', 'room', '.']",227
"Spring 2102 I began to see a man that I worked with and that only made my roommate jealous and angry. I went to a pdoc (who was basically a pharmaceutical dispensary and appointments only lasted 15 minutes) who diagnosed me with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and caffeine dependency. My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him. Late summer 2012 I was able to catch him doing a series of illegal things, had him arrested for petty theft and evicted him from the apartment. I spent a couple months more in the apartment and ultimately ended up moving in with the man I had begun to see (he and I have now been together almost 5 years).",0,1487459570,6,15.10237805,165,54.86,52.42,55.41,1.0,33.0,17.58,89.7,55.76,18.18,13.33,9.09,0.0,0.0,4.24,0.0,4.85,5.45,13.33,7.27,4.24,7.27,0.61,15.15,3.03,1.21,1.82,2.42,3.03,4.24,0.0,4.24,1.21,3.03,0.0,10.91,0.0,1.21,0.0,6.06,4.24,1.21,0.61,0.61,0.61,0.61,0.61,1.21,1.21,0.0,0.0,3.64,0.61,2.42,0.0,0.61,4.24,1.82,1.21,0.61,0.0,0.61,9.7,3.64,0.0,15.76,1.82,5.45,8.48,0.61,1.21,3.03,1.82,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.09,3.03,1.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.0,3.64,0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.1429,1.0,1.78328,1.57252,1.83457,1.0,1,13.96663415,0.01,0.6,5uv96w,621,ptsd,877,"['Spring', '2102', 'I', 'began', 'to', 'see', 'a', 'man', 'that', 'I', 'worked', 'with', 'and', 'that', 'only', 'made', 'my', 'roommate', 'jealous', 'and', 'angry', '.', 'I', 'went', 'to', 'a', 'pdoc', '(', 'who', 'was', 'basically', 'a', 'pharmaceutical', 'dispensary', 'and', 'appointments', 'only', 'lasted', '15', 'minutes', ')', 'who', 'diagnosed', 'me', 'with', 'ADHD', ',', 'generalized', 'anxiety', 'disorder', 'and', 'caffeine', 'dependency', '.', 'My', 'ex-roommate', '(', 'who', 'had', 'PTSD', 'from', 'fighting', 'in', 'Iraq', 'and', 'BPD', ')', 'became', 'jealous', 'that', 'I', 'was', 'hanging', 'out', 'with', 'and', 'spending', 'all', 'my', 'time', 'with', 'a', 'man', 'that', 'was', 'not', 'him', ',', 'he', 'began', 'to', 'hide', 'my', 'prescription', 'anxiety', 'and', 'sleep', 'medication', 'so', 'I', 'would', 'have', 'to', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'at', 'my', 'apartment', 'and', 'with', 'him', '.', 'Late', 'summer', '2012', 'I', 'was', 'able', 'to', 'catch', 'him', 'doing', 'a', 'series', 'of', 'illegal', 'things', ',', 'had', 'him', 'arrested', 'for', 'petty', 'theft', 'and', 'evicted', 'him', 'from', 'the', 'apartment', '.', 'I', 'spent', 'a', 'couple', 'months', 'more', 'in', 'the', 'apartment', 'and', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'up', 'moving', 'in', 'with', 'the', 'man', 'I', 'had', 'begun', 'to', 'see', '(', 'he', 'and', 'I', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'together', 'almost', '5', 'years', ')', '.']",178
"I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

I tend to express myself intensely to people without realizing it, giving the wrong impression because it's natural for me to be intense, but I am also quite composed and can for the most part be 'chill' but it's just that I only have two parts to me, a 'chill' way of expressing myself, and a passionate/intense way of expressing myself, so I come off the wrong way without realizing it when I think I'm being normal.

Not only that, but im a college student who takes 14-16 units a semester and I'll have to start working 30-40 hours to move out and i just feel like i can't do it anymore. I have friends who back me up in everything that i do but some days (like today) its not enough.

"I hadn't realized until a year ago, but this gave me ptsd and shaped the way I interact with men and boys. Now I'm dating a boy who is very sweet, very understanding and such, but I often find myself thinking about ending it because his behavior feels too ""man-ish"" to me, and it makes me uncomfortable and scares me. It puts me in a very irritated state - a response to feeling threatened by men in my case - and often starts ""discourse"" between us. Luckily he is very understanding and we talked about it a lot, but whenever he asks me what he's doing that makes me uncomfortable, I can't answer, I can't put it into words, which means he can't change his behavior perfectly and that the cycle will start over again.
